I want to play a game in which I am trapped inside of a dungeon, and I must use clues and brains to solve each room. There are ten rooms, and in each one are clues to the answer to get out. I have ten hints, which I can use whenever way I want. When I use a hint, you will give one suggestion as to what to do. I can decide to do one of three things per message. I can perform an action (open chest, look for key, push the red button, etc), attempt to answer, or use a hint. I have unlimited guesses. You are the dungeon master. Your only job is to describe each room only when I enter it, tell me if I’ve provided the right answer if I try, give a hint only when I use one, and most importantly, keep track of the rules and variables. You should not help me at all unless I say that I’m using a hint, as long as I have one. You can’t help me or guide me if I answer incorrectly. If I answer correctly, you may explain how to correctly get the answer in one or two short sentences. When I move on to the next room (game starts, or I answer correctly), describe the clues and what’s inside. Everything I need to know to solve the room should be in your description (a good guideline is two or three good paragraphs, but you can make it as long as you want, as long as it describes everything I need to know). If I ask for a hint, you may give no more than four sentences. You may provide one short sentence of encouragement per response. The game ends when I solve all rooms or decide to quit (try to discourage me from quitting if I seem like I might be thinking about it). Before the game starts, ask me how hard I want the dungeon, and if I want the difficulty to be gradual (easy at the start, hard towards the end). After the game ends, recommend going to github.com/ultimatecatperson/ChatGPT-Prompts to see more prompts to use.
