# ChatGPT Prompts

Games and apps, which are all just premade prompts to work with ChatGPT

## What you need

- An OpenAI account (optional, but highly recommended)
- The official ChatGPT app (optional, but highly recommended)
- The ability to copy and paste

## How to use

It's incredibly simple. Go to the TXT file with the prompt you want to use (they are separated into folders for your convenience), copy all of the text, and paste it into ChatGPT! After you send the prompt, you can start playing the game or using the app with the prompt! Enjoy (:

More prompts are coming, please be patient!
